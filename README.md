## Installation
:warning: **NOTE:** Before executing `install.sh`, modify the `subEnumTools()` function by placing your **Virustotal**, **Passivetotal**, **SecurityTrails**, **Censys**, **Riddler**, and **Shodan API keys**. This will give better results during the subdomain enumeration.
```
git clone https://github.com/capt-meelo/LazyRecon.git
cd LazyRecon
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

## How to Use
